# Deployment Guide - Smart Scheme Predictor

Since this is a static website, you can host it online for free in just a few seconds.

## Recommended Method: Netlify Drop (Fastest)

1.  Open [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop) in your browser.
2.  Open your **Desktop** and find the `netaji` folder.
3.  **Drag and Drop** the entire `netaji` folder directly onto the Netlify Drop webpage.
4.  Your site will be live instantly! Netlify will provide you with a public URL (e.g., `https://smart-scheme-predictor.netlify.app`).

## Alternative: Vercel

1.  Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com).
2.  Choose "Add New" -> "Project".
3.  Select "Upload Folder" and choose the `netaji` folder from your Desktop.
4.  Click "Deploy".

## Important Note
- Any changes you make to the files locally on your Desktop will **not** automatically update the live site. You will need to drag and drop the folder again to update it.
- To avoid this, in the future, we can set up a **GitHub** repository which will update the site automatically whenever a change is made.
